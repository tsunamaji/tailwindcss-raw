> [!TIP]
> Although this package is built on Tailwind CSS, it only uses its engine and also ships it as a dependency.<br>Therefore, **installation of Tailwind CSS is generally not required specifically for the `tailwindcss-raw` package**.

## What is this plugin for?

In TailwindCSS v3, the engine allowed passing RAW HTML, which could then be interpreted as source and used to extract the generated CSS as a result. This enabled the creation of a lot of automation.

In TailwindCSS v4, this feature was removed, and everyone now has to handle the engine’s interpretation individually. The `tailwindcss-raw` package solves this problem and is distributed as open-source so that, by using it, others can save time: passing RAW HTML input to `tailwindcss-raw` generates the corresponding CSS output.
